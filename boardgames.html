 <p> Board games became important to me because of my time in college and volunteering in Ecuador. 
 Whenever a board game was played it was always a time of fun but also a time when the people involved could just talk and have a conversation.
 Board games were pivotal to my college experience because that's what I always played during snow days. What do college students do if they have a whole day to themselves besides drinking?
 Play boardgames like Risk, Monopoly or an old-fashioned card game? I loved these times because all we did was talk about life and just have conversations.

 <p>Boardgames and card games played a big part of my year of volunteering at Rostro. 
 With only one 13 inch tv with no cable for 6 post grad students, what were we supposed to do?
 Card games became the way of the land as a game of "chinese poker" was played daily between 3 of the 6 community mates.
We started a tally of who was the overall leader of the game. Conversations were aplenty and they always resided through a game of Chinese poker.
The most important board game seen is Settlers of Catan. Hour and hours were spent playing that game with my community mates. 
When I mention community mates, I meant the people I volunteered with through my time volunteering in Ecuador. </p>
<p>My community mates know me the best and were with me through my struggles and joys. 
Settlers was always a fun time and it was something that united us during times of grief, discomfort and even sadness.
Settlers is forever a sign of my time in Rostro and I'm thankful it became part of my life. </p>
