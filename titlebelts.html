    <p>Below you will find two replica championship belts sitting side by side.
   What you see are the WWE World Heavyweight Championship and the WCW United States Championship. These belts give me an odd sense of pleasure.
   The pleasure stems from dreaming of holding a championship belt after winning a pivotal wrestling match.
   It's the closest I will ever feel to being a wrestler. </p>
   <p>The belts have no value except when I let my imagination flow by putting it on my waist or atop of a shoulder and imagine to be a wrestling champion.
   As a child watching wrestling, this was the only thing I imagined when viewing. Being the champion meant you were the best. Wrestling took over my life as a 9 year old. 
   One day in 4th grade, all the kids were talking about what had happened last night at Wrestlemania 2000. I felt like a complete loser for not having a clue what they were talking about.
   I tuned in to watch wrestling that night. All I remember were DX members saying "Suck it" and The Rock coming out to cheers from the crowd.
   From that night, I was hooked, I watched wrestling religiously on Mondays for years with very few breaks. I truly loved it.</p>
   <br>
   <p> Wrestling has gotten through my darkest days and has always been a show I can watch and just relax. 
   But what's important about wrestling is your perspective of the product changes as you get older.
   As an adult you don't see it as two opponents fighting with each other but two or more people telling a story in the ring. 
   Stories are told through moves in the ring or how characters square up in the ring.
   One story may be the champion vs the challenger while one might be the hero vs the underdog. The amount of ways you can tell the same story is vast.
   The story has always gotten the older wrestling fans to stay. It's what keeps me into the product.</p>

  <p> I first purchased the Gold belt toward the end of the summer heading to my senior year at Loyola. I saved all summer for the gag gift. When I first received it, I was so excited that I hoisted it on top of my shoulder in my dorm all day.
  The belt was primarily used as a prop in events such as Halloween and my 21st birthday.  
   The WCW United States Championship was a gift given to me by my friend Heidi. 
She entered a raffle for me and paid the ticket for the opportunity to win. She had no incentive to do it but just to make me happy.
    I cherish it because it reminds me of my year with Heidi and my volunteer year Rostro de Cristo.</p>
