        <h1>History of the Room</h1>
        </div>
        <p>The building was first built in the 1920's but my immediate family didn't enter the building until the early 1990s. 
        My mom and dad weren't the first members of my family to live there but my aunt and uncle with my cousins.
        We moved to thebuilding in 1992. We lived on the third floor in a one bedroom apartment.
        In 1997, we moved into the apartment.The room in question wasn't always my room but a shared room between my sister and I. The massive room was first separated with a divider in the middle. 
         They literally built a wall separating my sister and I. The wall was meant to give us privacy and not bother each other. The wall ended up being an invasion of privacy. From hearing private phone calls, changing the tv channel
         to piss off the other sibling,these were all shenanigans that my sister and I got ourselves into. Throught these situations, my sister and I learned how to co-exist with each other but more importantly, how to co-exist with others. 
         Because of her, I woke up to Celine Dion and Backstreet Boys sing alongs at 7 am for a good 6 years. To this day, I know the lyrics and enjoy pop music and love songs.

         <br>
         <p>What was interesting about the room was that I had the inner part of the room and my sister had the outerpart of the room. Whenever my sister had a friend over, she always had to walk in my room first. 
         I became a nosy guy as I always tried to listen in on what my sister was talking about with her friends. I went to college in Baltimore which caused me to leave my part of the room vacant. My sister had the room to herself with the wall still standing high. 
         During my junior year of college, while studying abroad in El Salvador, my sister moved to Los Angeles for a job opportunity. With both of us gone, my mother saw no reason to keep the wall. Like the Berlin Wall and hopefully the border wall, it came down as soon as possible. Here was the new era of the room.
         My sister's bed was chosen over mine as it is queen sized.My sister never moved back as she got engaged and married. The room was mine for the first time. 
        It has become mine in that all my memorabilia now lies in it. I have always come back here after stints in college, a year of service and even a position out in Philadelphia. The room is home to me. </p>
