<p> The photo is a US Postal Service Package. The address is where my ex-girlfriend used to live, but what's inside are notes, letters and items that were sent during our 6 month attempt of 
a long-distance relationship. While it's over, it holds symbolic significance to me. For me, it was an attempt to hold something together regardless of how far apart we were physically.
It's an attempt of trying to make something work despite how difficult it can really be. All those notes, messages, letters, items, gifts are works of labor in trying to make something work despite the odds. </p>
<br>
<p>When I was younger, I always thought that long distance relationships weren't real relationships.
How real can they be if the people were physically far apart. In my head, I mocked people who were in a long distance relationship and wonderered, "Why are they doing this?"
Until I got myself into that situation did I realize how a long distance relationship is ,in my opinion, more intimate that a relationship where the people live closer together. 
The amount of effort needed to try to make it work. From the daily scheduling such as finding a time to chat, texting throughout the day but also trying to manage our feelings throughout the days were difficult.
How do we cope when the other is having a bad day? The relationship was work and what's important about a long distance relationship is for it to work,people have to put their time and effort.The couple has to believe it's going to work.
It's an admirable task because giving up on it is so much easier than trying to make it work. The package serves as a reminder of how much effort I have put in something I have loved. It also serves as a reminder that I am capable of being loved and capable of loving in return. </p>
