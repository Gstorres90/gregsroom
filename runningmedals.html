    <p> Below are running medals I earned this past year. I cherish these because these medals shows my ability to train and excel in something 
     I thought I couldn't do. I initially wanted to run the Bronx 10 mile run because I saw my sister finish the Brooklyn Half Marathon.</p>
     
    <p>I was inspired by her willingness to run despite little training. 
    At the time, I was looking for a full-time position but only working part-time hours.
    I had a lot of spare time and needed to put my mind on something else after my breakup with Johanna.
    It wasn't easy for me to start running. I only had a few months to prepare for a 10 mile run. I had to get in shape. 
    I started running the outer edge of the park which is about 6 miles. Slowly but surely I would run the 6 miles eventually. 
    I was stubborn because whenever I went to Central Park I had to walk/jog the 6 miles.
    My mentality was that I did not take the D train for over 30 minutes just to run 3 miles and come back. 
    I started initially with a 2 mile run then minute walk and jog, I was eventually able to get in good enough shape to run 6 miles consecutively.
    Once the Bronx 10 mile race came, I knew I could run 8 miles without stopping. The day of the race, I was nervous that I was going to get tired and not be able to finish. 
    Adrenaline is one hell of a drug! I finished and with good energy. The way I felt after that race made me feel invincible. 
    With finishing the 10 mile race in relatively good health, I signed up for the Staten Island Half Marathon.
    The day of this race, I was hesitant but I started feeling it after mile 10. I wasn't as ready as I thought I was.
    After the 10 miles, I was exhausted. The conditions were horrific as we ran during a rainstorm while it was 50 degrees. I was wet from the beginning of the race. 
    Adrenaline and pure determination willed me to finish the race. 
    After the finish, I could barely walk and limping like a mad men. I was cold, constantly shivering with no chance of warming up. Walking back to the Staten Island Ferry was a struggle and taking
    the subway home was hard. I needed a 10 sec head start in order to get up and exit the car.</p>
    <p> But in the end, I am happy with what I accomplished and I know if training for a race comes again I know how to prepare.</p>
