    <p> You thought there would be a pair of jordans under this shoebox?  What I keep here are notes and letters from friends that I have received since
    I would say the start of college. So I would say about 2010. Maybe this is just something about me but I like to cherish memories. It's somebody's words trapped in time.
     I have letters that were sent to me while I studied abroad in college. I studied abroad in El Salvador and Denmark. 
     The letters are frozen in time which helps me reminisce where I was during that stage in my life. </p>
     <p>I have letters from friends while I was in the following places.
    <ul> 
    <li>El Salvador</li>
    <li>Denmark</li>
    <li> Ecuador</li>
    <li> France </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>But what I cherish the most is the affirmations letters I received throughout events I have worked in. I have worked with many colleges and high schools during my time with Rostro as well as my time at Saint Joseph's University.
    It shows moments of love and thankfulness during a particular trip. Honestly, during times of loneliness or feeling down, I have looked at these notes and go deep into the memories and remember moments of despair and happiness.
