    <p>Bureau while very messy in this pic (continues to be) holds many things that are important to me. 
    Below you will find the three items that the bureau holds that are of significance to me.</p>
    <h3> Snorlax</h3>
    <p>Yea it's just a toy snorlax, from my cousin Ricky as he worked abroad for a few months in Japan. The Snorlax shows just how much I love Pokemon. I practically grew up with Pokemon as a child and it's something
    I hold dearly in my heart. Pokemon represents my childhood as I was obsessed with the gameboy games but I also collected the cards. I studied so hard so I can get pokemon cards when report cards came up.
    I used to know all 150 of the original Pokemon as well as I would religiously wake up every Saturday morning to watch the Pokemon cartoons. I was hooked! I hope to have that Snorlax hanging in front of my rearview mirror of my car one day. </p>
 
     <h3>Danish Flag</h3>
 <p>Such a small piece of memorabilia but it's one of my souveneirs that I purchased from my semester abroad. I studied abroad in Denmark during the Spring Semester of my Junior year.
 Study Abroad was an opportunity for me to explore Europe for 4 months. I was able to visit over 11 countries during that time. Looking back what I loved was I never really in a comfort zone overthere. 
 Everything was always new as I adjusted to different languages constantly.
 I had to be okay in being the foreigner and follow the culture. What I loved about the experience was I was able to live with a host family.
 The family took me in and brought me to all their family events. We had dinner with the grandparents, went to family dinners and even went to their farm house in Sweden.
 I was able to meet two great friends there. Jaclyn went to Loyola with me but we didn't really become friends until we met in Denmark. We traveled together, ate together and became
 best friends. I met LisAurel because her host family told her there was another American in the same town. 
 What The next thing she did was called my host family on their home phone and asked to speak to me.
 From there, we started taking the train together and did some light traveling as well. What was cool was that she ended up moving to NYC and we were able to rekindle our friendship. 
 She was able to meet my family and become good friends with one of my cousins.
 </p>
 
 <h3>Saint Martha photo frame</h3>
 
 <p>Saint Martha plays a huge role in my life as this was the saint my mother gave my sister and I when we were born. Saint Martha has been given the responsibility
 of taking care of us.She has been in my room everyplace I have ever lived. This photo frame has traveled to Baltimore, Philly, Denmark, El Salvador and Ecuador. She has always been there when I have woken up in the morning.
 I have a Saint Martha prayer card in my wallet alway with me when I travel. I personally enjoy the saint because I see her as a protector. My mother's faith shows that she trusts the saint to take care of me everywhere I go. </p>
